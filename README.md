### Coworking Party

Have fun getting stuff done.

https://coworking.party

Very much a work in progress. Post your bugs and ideas to the [issues](https://github.com/jschuur/coworking.party/issues) and check out the [current priorities](https://github.com/users/jschuur/projects/7). [Contributions](https://github.com/jschuur/coworking.party/labels/good%20first%20issue) welcome. Especially a [logo](https://github.com/jschuur/coworking.party/issues/17).

## API

Currently, you can post a status update via the API with at least one of a free text 'update' field (up to 200 characters) or a 'status' option from the [userSelectableStatusOptions](./src/statusOptions.ts) list of options plus your 'apiKey'.

Make a POST request to `https://coworking-party-party.jschuur.partykit.dev/party/main/status` with a raw JSON body like this:

```JSON
{
    "apiKey": "YOUR API KEY HERE",
    "update": "Playing Helldivers 2!",
    "status": "gaming"
}
```
### Available Statuses

```
online, admin, analyzing, building, chores, coding, creating, debugging,
designing, enjoying, errands, exercising, fixing, filming, focusing, food,
gaming, hobbying, learning, listening, maintaining, managing, meeting,
outside, optimising, organising, parenting, partner, partying, performing,
planning, procrastinating, reading, recording, relaxing, releasing,
researching, reviewing, sciencing, selfcare, shopping, sleeping,
socialising, streaming, teaching, travelling, trying, watching, working,
worshipping, writing

```


Until the API key is exposed on the site under your [profile settings](https://github.com/jschuur/coworking.party/issues/6), track down Joost and ask him for yours (seems safe, right?).

## Local Development

If you're looking to contribute or just want to try running this locally, here's a quick setup guide:

1. Clone the repo and install the dependencies. Note that some of the scripts in `package.json` have explicit references to [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) that you may wish to adjust if you use a different package manager.
2. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project based on the `.env.example` file and adjust the secrets as needed.
3. Create a free [Turso](https://turso.tech/) account, [install the CLI](https://docs.turso.tech/cli/introduction), run `turso auth login` and initialise the local database with `pnpm run db:migrate`. Local development uses a [local](https://docs.turso.tech/local-development) Turso dev instance. The `DATABASE_URL` secret already points to http://127.0.0.1:8080 (no auth token needed for local dev).
4. [PartyKit](https://docs.partykit.io/) should not require an account for local development, but create a new `partykit.json` file in the root of the project based on `partykit.example.json`.
5. Create a [Twitch app](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps) and [Discord app](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) and define the respective `AUTH_` secrets in the `.env` file. You could use just one and modify the `providers` in `src/authConfigEdge.ts` accordingly. Also add a random `AUTH_SECRET`.
6. Configure the OAuth callback URLs for the Twitch and Discord apps to point to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/twitch` and `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/discord` respectively on their dev portals.

Configuring additional third party services (Posthog, Google Analytics, Sentry, Discord webhook URL etc) is optional. The app will run gracefully without them.

### Running Coworking Party Locally

[SST Ion](https://ion.sst.dev/) is used to deploy the app to AWS. The default `pnpm run dev` script also uses SST for [live](https://ion.sst.dev/docs/live/) mode during local development, which would require a [configured AWS account](https://docs.sst.dev/setting-up-aws) and the [3.0 sst CLI](https://ion.sst.dev/docs/reference/cli/) installed.

For local development, you can skip SST and needing an AWS account by running `pnpm run dev-nosst` instead. This launches Next.js with the regular `next dev` command, along with all the other local services (Turso, PartyKit, etc).

The local Next.js app will be at http://localhost:3000/, a local [Drizzle Studio](https://orm.drizzle.team/drizzle-studio/overview) instance to manage the database at https://local.drizzle.studio/ and the PartyKit instance at port 1999. This means you can hit http://localhost:1999/party/main/debug e.g. to see the PartyKit debug endpoint.
